# Wild-Animal-Detection-Using-YOLO
This project focuses on detecting wild animals in real-time using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. It aims to provide a fast and accurate way to identify the presence of potentially dangerous animals in monitored areas such as forests, wildlife reserves, or rural farmlands.
